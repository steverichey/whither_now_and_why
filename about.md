# About

The contents of [readme.md](./readme.md) are the transcribed text of [W. E. B. Du Bois'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._E._B._Du_Bois) speech to the Association of Negro Social Science Teachers on March 31, 1960 in Charlotte, [North Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte,_North_Carolina). This transcription was performed by myself, and based on the contents of the cards from which I presume he read while giving the speech.

I have published this as a GitHub repository largely as an experiment in making this sort of information more widely available; while I found a number of PDFs containing the text of this speech online, none of them had accurately converted the text to a readable format, relying largely on OCR conversion, which was riddled with errors.

Note that by publishing this I am in no way taking credit for Dr. Du Bois work, nor am I endorsing the entire contents of this speech. However, I do feel it is an important speech which should be read more widely, as is the case with much of his work.

If I have made any error in transcription please open an issue.
